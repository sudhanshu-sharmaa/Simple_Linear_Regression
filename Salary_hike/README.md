# Salary_hike — Simple Linear Regression

## Problem Statement
Build a prediction model to estimate salary based on years of experience using simple linear regression.

## Dataset
- **Salary_hike.csv**: Contains two columns — YearsExperience and Salary.

## Modeling Approach
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationship.
- Built a simple linear regression model in both Excel and Python.
- Compared model metrics (R² and RMSE) to select the best fit.
- Generated predictions for 3 new experience values.

## Files Included
- `Salary_hike.csv`: Raw dataset.
- `excel_model.xlsx`: Regression model built in Excel.
- `python_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with EDA, modeling, and predictions.
- `salary_linear_regression.html`: HTML export of the notebook.
- `predictions_salary.csv`: Predicted salaries for 3 new experience values.

## How to Reproduce
1. Open the notebook (`python_notebook.ipynb`) and run all cells.
2. Check the Excel file for regression output and prediction formulas.
3. View the HTML file for a clean report version.
