Simple-Linear-Regression
Assignments on linear regression models for Delivery_time and Salary_hike datasets

Problem Statements
1. Delivery_time
Predict delivery time based on sorting time using a simple linear regression model. The goal is to understand how sorting time influences delivery time and build a predictive model using both Excel and Python.

2. Salary_hike
Build a prediction model to estimate salary based on years of experience using simple linear regression. The objective is to quantify the relationship and generate predictions using both Excel and Python.
